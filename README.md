# shellphish-docker

Pack my [yiyu0x/shellphish](https://github.com/yiyu0x/shellphish) project in docker container.

Now, just run `docker run -it yiyu0x/shellphish bash shellphish.sh` and the server will be start!

Or, use `docker run -it yiyu0x/shellphish` to go into container and run `bash shellphish.sh`.
